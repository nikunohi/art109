            <h1>The Future Web</h1>
        </section>



        <section class="body-type">
            <p>On a cloudy June morning in DC nearly two decades ago, United States Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska stood
                proudly before his committee and declared his distaste for an internet he deemed too… tubular?
            </p>
        </section>



        <section class="body-type">
            <p> I’ll leave the quote below so you can get a better idea of what he was going for… </p>
        </section>


        <section class="future-type">
            <p> “An [email] was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on Friday. I got it yesterday [Tuesday].
                Why? Because it got tangled up with all these things going on the Internet commercially. [...]The
                Internet is not something that you just dump something on. It's not a big truck. <span class="big">It's
                    a series
                    of tubes.</span>
                And if you don't understand, those tubes can be filled and if they are filled, when you put your message
                in, it gets in line and it's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube enormous amounts of
                material.”
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="body-type">
            <p> I don’t fully blame him for his childlike understanding of the internet. It’s common to assign things we
                don’t completely understand magical, sometimes even tubular, properties. Besides, we’re all human. Even
                at 83 years old at the time of this convoluted metaphor, Senator Stevens still had some learning to do
                about this emergent phenomenon that would only grow more and more prominent.

            </p>
        </section>



        <section class="body-type">
            <p>I will also admit that I am in a similar boat as Senator Stevens. While I’ve used the internet for as
                long as I can remember, and am way passed a tube-based understanding of it, I’ve only recently
                started actively creating things for the internet, and have much to learn about the technical
                intricacies of the web we take for granted. However, I feel like my relationship with the internet is a
                bit more conducive to its continued well-being.
            </p>
        </section>



        <section class="body-type">
            <p>This is to say, the problem with Ted’s comments is not in the absurdly anachronistic metaphor he
                employed, but that his only understanding of the internet is within the context of its use as a tool or
                technology.
            </p>
        </section>



        <section class="body-type">
            <p>In present, I’m sad to report that things have only worsened during the time since the senator’s speech.
                While
                social media has revolutionized the way we communicate through the internet, and many large companies
                have taken over the search results with their homepages, our consumption of the internet is headed
                towards the extremes of needs-based use. With the inception of LLMs and consumer-accessible AI, this
                trouble furthers as we resort to and rely on the internet rather than more mindfully integrating it into
                our everyday lives. It seems like many of the people who use the internet
                nowadays only do so out of a
                growing need, at some point crossing the border to dependency.
            </p>
        </section>


        <section class="body-type">
            <p>While Ted’s imagination only took him as far as a truck or a tube, I hope that, in the
                future, the internet turns out to be more like a lively street corner....

        <section class="first-paragraph">
            <p>. . .
            </p>
        </section>


        <section class="future-type">
            <p>...A hundred years from now, the internet will be a street corner frequented by people who care about the
                well-being of the internet outside of its consideration for the “most convenient human innovation”
                awards.
            </p>
        </section>



        <section class="future-type">
            <p>Sure, there will be many conveniences to be enjoyed from visiting the street corner—what with the
                camaraderie and business conducted there—but <span class="big">people will neither exclusively live on
                    the corner</span> for its
                sheer ease of use, <span class="big">nor will they only begrudgingly swing by</span> when an issue is
                large enough to trump
                their
                apprehension to and distrust of the corner.
            </p>
        </section>



        <section class="future-type">
            <p>Most importantly, people will begin to see the internet as a place in time rather than a tool or
                technology. <span class="big">It is because of our presence on the internet at this current time in
                    culture and
                    society</span>—rather than the mere existence of the internet itself—<span class="big">that we are
                    afforded
                    opportunities to
                    nurture relationships, partake in culture, or learn new truths.</span> Because the corner is so
                ubiquitous yet
                digestible, accessible yet well-maintained, we are drawn to it—as a place adjacent, not distinct, to the
                physical world—to build recreation, identity, and business, among countless other things.
            </p>
        </section>



        <section class="future-type">
            <p>In this place in time, the internet will truly be for those to explore. Rather than the current craze
                around hyper-curated feeds, we will have to actively seek out and form our sensibilities surrounding the
                internet and what it offers. <span class="big">Freshly dropped off near the entrance of this vast
                    community, you could
                    easily stumble upon a seemingly mundane website archiving poorly parked cars in a certain area, or
                    perhaps a web-based recipe book put together by an anonymous grandparent, or maybe a massive online
                    marketplace.</span> No matter what may be out there, only through venturing out and truly
                experiencing this new
                net world will we grow to understand the culture and norms of the new digital street corner. These
                experiences will also give us a more meaningful relationship and understanding of the net as a whole,
                and invest us more heavily in its maintenance and care.
            </p>
        </section>




        <section class="future-type">
            <p>In reality, the ideal net of the future won’t be so dissimilar from the net of old; a vast street corner
                whose countless denizens are unfettered by curation and undeterred from settling their own plot on the
                avenue, populating it with anything they please. <span class="big">In the not-so-distant past, we had an
                    internet which,
                    if not nearly as robust, was almost completely made up of and supported by those who understood not
                    only
                    its technological potential, but also its enormous social and cultural potential.</span> As a result
                of their
                optimism and wide-eyed wonder, these netizens had a more meaningful relationship with the internet that
                kept them invested in the beautification of their digital space.
                <span class="big">And people... just kinda<span class="big"> made what they wanted</span> to and put it
                    on the web.</span> "Beautification" wasn't an exercise in making their sites as visible or as
                navigable as
                possible; it was
                a reflection of the sensibilities they had nurtured from their experiences at the street
                corner. These same sensibilities can't be developed in an environment where everything around us
                eventually terminates into what gets us the most clicks, or keeps us on top of the latest trends.

        <section class="future-type">
            <p>So I guess what I really see in the ideal future of the web is <span class="big">more sincerity</span>;
                for those who visit the
                street corner to treat it with as much wonder and genuine curiosity as those who remember a time when
                the web wasn't just seen as a means to an end. </p>

        <section class="body-type">
            <p>Ironically enough, maybe my ideal future internet reflects a more earnest and culturally vibrant
                ecosystem
                that we lost not so long before a certain senator shared his speculations.</p>
